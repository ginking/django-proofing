Version: .1

Django-Proofing is a django plugin that allows the creation of photo galleries and is a fork of django-photologue. With Proofing, photos can belong to one gallery and one gallery can belong to one category. Future releases of Proofing will allow for galleries of videos as well.

Proofing was originally created for photographers to be able to proof senior, family, and sporting event pictures. It gives them the ability to setup private proofing areas where their clients can view their images. Other applications such as Stachmo could be integrated with Proofing to enable adding photos to a cart, favorites, and even purchase.


Proofing Features:

	- On the fly thumbnail generation (on-demand thumbnails)
	- Images can be any size
	- Image view counts can optionally be tracked
	- Watermarks can be applied to any image
	- Galleries can be password protected (currently only by django default user auth)

Proofing First Class Objects

	- Category, Gallery, Photo
	- Photosize (determines what sizes/styles of images can be displayed in templates)
	- Watermark (watermarks are per photosize)
